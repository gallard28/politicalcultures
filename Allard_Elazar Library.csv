Our dynamic measure of state policy liberalism marks an important advance over existing measures, almost all of which are purely cross-sectional and thus cannot be used to study policy change. We find that, in the aggregate, the policy liberalism of U.S. states steadily increased between the 1930s and 1970s and then largely plateaued. The policy liberalism of most states has remained stable in relative terms, though several states have shifted considerably over time. We also find surprisingly little evidence of multidimensionality in state policy outputs. Our new estimates of state policy liberalism have broad application to the study of political development, representation, accountability, and other important issues in political science.","2016-10-01","2018-11-26 20:43:06","2018-11-26 20:43:17","2018-11-26 20:43:06","899-913","","4","60","","","","","","","","","","en","©2015, Midwest Political Science Association","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/8KLRM8L9/Caughey and Warshaw - 2016 - The Dynamics of State Policy Liberalism, 1936–2014.pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/Q8X62K6E/ajps.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has emphasized the impact of structural determinants on levels of decentralization across countries. However, we argue that decentralization processes are endogenous to legislative bargaining by political parties. Our main hypothesis is that, ceteris paribus, the greater the legislative bargaining power of parties with decentralization demands, the more likely decentralization reforms are to occur. For that purpose, we calculate an index of the parliamentary salience of decentralization that reflects the distribution of parties’ preferences for decentralization weighted by their bargaining power. We test our hypotheses with dynamic models for 19 parliamentary democracies using Comparative Manifesto Project data and the Regional Authority Index. We demonstrate that the dynamics of decentralization are crucially shaped by the configuration of national legislatures, although this only seems to affect the self-rule dimension of decentralization rather than shared rule.","2014-05-01","2018-11-27 13:13:43","2018-11-27 13:13:50","2018-11-27 13:13:43","820-850","","6","47","","Comparative Political Studies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/RFV5A28Z/Amat and Falcó-Gimeno - 2014 - The Legislative Dynamics of Political Decentraliza.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These protests, which we term ?valence protests,? do not fit easily into typical narratives about contentious behavior: they are neither social movements, nor revolutionary, nor a manifestation of organized labor?instead, many of these protests are a collective expression of a valence issue of which the government is well aware. We argue for a different conceptual framework for valence protests and contend that they are a way for politically engaged citizens to express their political preferences when voting is insufficient.

It finds that effective implementation of non-contributory social policies depends on political alignments across different territorial levels. Subnational units governed by the opposition hinder the implementation of national policies, but only if the policy carries clear attribution of responsibility. On one hand, conditional cash transfers have clear attribution of responsibility and thus, pose risks for opposition subnational governments, who, as a result, have incentives to obstruct such policies. On the other hand, in social services, attribution of responsibility is blurred, and therefore their implementation is not shaped by political alignments. By analyzing policy implementation, disaggregating social policies, and incorporating multilevel political alignments, this article contributes to theories of the welfare state and multilevel governance. The empirical foundation includes an analysis of the factors that shape the successful implementation of social policies in Argentina and Brazil through a combination of pooled time-series analysis and extensive field research.","2015-11-18","2018-11-27 13:16:37","2018-11-27 13:16:37","2018-11-27","457-498","","4","49","","Comparative Political Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach addresses issues of reverse causality and spuriousness by examining how different historical trajectories of nation-state formation, and the state strategies and capabilities to provide public goods associated with each, might have shaped both contemporary diversity and public goods provision.

This article addresses this problem by proposing strategies that integrate historical institutionalism?s insights into endogenous institutional change with a systematic analysis of the institutional conditions under which ?bottom-up? processes of gradual change are likely to be counteracted. In particular, the institutionalization of cultural categories and the allocation of power over the timing of reform within institutional and policy configurations are important variables for understanding how preexisting institutions may enable institutional incumbents to channel, delay, or prevent institutional change altogether.","2016-02-10","2018-11-27 13:16:38","2018-11-27 13:16:38","2018-11-27","1095-1127","","8","49","","Comparative Political Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These informal relationships under colonial rule affect contemporary economic governance. To clarify the importance of social exclusion rather than other factors that may differentiate colonial districts with large Chinese populations, I exploit variation in the settlement patterns of Chinese and Arab trading minorities in Java, which played comparable roles in the island?s colonial economy but faced different degrees of social exclusion.

Economically autonomous brokers are more likely to rely on sanctions than reciprocity. Evidence to support both the proposed typology of broker strategies and their determinants is collected in Senegal, a clientelistic democracy where group-level heterogeneity generates natural variation in broker types. A coordination game played with real brokers illustrates that participants are less likely to sacrifice personal gain when brokers are competitively selected, more likely when they most fear retribution.

Heteroscedastic multilevel models allow for directly modeling the development of the variance of types of democracy over time, revealing information about convergence, and adding substantial explanations.

European democracies are far from secular, and matters of religious regulation cannot be reduced to abstract values or constitutional clauses. Under conditions of high state support of religion, accommodating new religious minorities involves not only the changing of existing rules but also giving up on long-standing traditions and everyday habits.

Though this decreases motivations for coup attempts, it also makes democracies more vulnerable should a coup attempt occur. Consequently, democratic constraints on executive power do not reduce the frequency of coup attempts, but coups attempted against democracies are much more likely to succeed. Using several data sets of coup activity and democratic constraints, I find significant differences in coup activity in democracies and non-democracies. Relative to civilian non-democracies, democracies are about half as likely to use coup-related repression, but they face a similar frequency of coup attempts.

I argue that opposition mayors and governors increase the chance of success against the president if they can transcend their interelite policy struggles with him and mobilize average citizens against recentralization. In Bolivia, the concentration of subnational opposition victories in eastern lowland departments, which share a common regional identity and dense organizational networks, enabled governors to enlist societal support in defense of decentralization, ultimately forcing compromise upon the president. In Ecuador and Venezuela in contrast, the diffusion of opposition jurisdictions foreclosed the possibility of encouraging societal opposition through appeals to common regional identities, allowing presidents to proceed with recentralization unchecked.","2013-06-04","2018-11-27 13:16:39","2018-11-27 13:16:39","2018-11-27","1130-1157","","8","47","","Comparative Political Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two arguments are proposed: first, a distinction between discursive perspectives and related mobilizing arguments helps to disentangle different thematic layers of debate, characterised as ‘problem-solving debates’ on the effectiveness of political action in the EU, ‘directional debates’ about the substantive goals of EU governance, and ‘legitimacy debates’ about the compatibility of supranational institutions with domestic democracy.

The authors found evidence that fiscal stress prevents fiscal reform in the short term, and leads to stronger fiscal rules in the long term. This pattern corresponds to the ‘war of attrition’ argument formulated by Alesina and Drazen [(1989) ‘Why are stabilizations delayed?’, The American Economic Review 81(5): 1170–88]. The authors found evidence that countries eager to join the EU showed their commitment to Maastricht targets by incorporating FRs into national laws. Countries facing financial difficulties after the 2009 sovereign debt crisis were coerced into adopting more stringent FRs to obtain fiscal support from the EU. Both cases support the idea that coercive diplomacy might explain the strength of national fiscal rules in the EU.","2017-06-17","2018-11-27 16:07:01","2018-11-27 16:07:01","2018-11-27 16:07:01","852-870","","6","24","","","The politics of fiscal rules within the European Union","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/3YFFJQWK/Doray-Demers and Foucault - 2017 - The politics of fiscal rules within the European U.pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/APL6XINA/13501763.2017.html","","","Coercion; diffusion; fiscal rules; fiscal stabilization; government deficits; political economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some policies lend themselves more to a strategy allowing for extensive domestication than others; but to be effective, decentralized implementing actors need both power and capabilities. Europeanization dynamics strongly influence the direction of domestication of EU policy, but if EU requirements are incompatible with national political preferences domestication trumps Europeanization. Domestication equally prevails if the relationship between EU and national policy is ambiguous and frontline implementers have high discretion. The trend toward the Europeanization of direct EU enforcement challenges its legitimacy.

It argues that existing theorizing suffers from two important weaknesses: concepts are poorly developed and not firmly rooted in public administration scholarship, and the literature pays insufficient attention to international administrations’ relationship with politics.

Given their extensive legal training, they can be expected to operate as ‘guardians of EU law’ and thus correct national non-compliant tendencies. Yet, they also have a role as politically loyal civil servants, responsive to national political demands. This conntribution answers the question of to what extent Dutch legislative drafters fulfil a role of ‘guardian of EU law’. Using in-depth interviews, the paper analyses legislative drafters’ role conceptions and their strategies in case national political demands prove incompatible with EU legal requirements.

We then outline some general conclusions and end by indicating future avenues of research. Taken together, the collection contributes some answers to the challenge of defining and measuring – in a comparative way – the control and co-ordination mechanisms which power dispersion generates.

How actors think about policy matters, and their thinking is not just a mechanistic function of uninterpreted conditions around them. Yet turning this intuition into clear claims about the influence of ideas is challenging. This contribution extracts guidelines from the growing literature on ideas to suggest how to best display four common kinds of intersections between ideas and context that make the ideas powerful. We can show that certain ideas gain influence because ‘believers’ obtain power for unrelated reasons; because the ideas somehow empower actors to achieve power; because they make possible new coalitions of actors; or because they inform the crafting or retooling of institutions that matter. The essay highlights what some of the strongest literature on ideas does well and how it can become still more persuasive.","2016-03-15","2018-11-27 16:31:03","2018-11-27 16:31:03","2018-11-27 16:31:03","446-463","","3","23","","","Ideas and power","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/6LUYMX2M/Parsons - 2016 - Ideas and power four intersections and how to sho.pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/TSISU4MG/13501763.2015.html","","","Explanation; ideas; methods; power; public policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applying an inductive approach, it presents empirical observations from the fields of crisis management and external climate policy, illustrating the occurrence of informal division of labour. It subsequently provides an analytical framework to map the key dimensions of its different manifestations: the enabling factors, starting point, subject, institutional embeddedness, exclusiveness and durability of informal division of labour. Four possible effects on EU foreign policy-making are then discussed: an increased internal and external effectiveness; and a strengthened internal and external legitimacy.

In this manuscript we provide a conceptualization of what we term the EU's ‘mandated participatory planning’ (MPP) approach. This approach is increasingly used to implement EU directives, mandating the explicit formulation of certain plans or programmes on mostly subnational or cross-national levels. Drawing on three empirical examples from (mostly) environmental policy, we argue that analysing MPP as such is useful to help identify challenges and possibilities for EU policy making. Our framework provides a means to organize inquiry and compare disparate policies, and to more broadly understand the integration of policy, planning and implementation. This perspective, in turn, sheds fresh light on familiar concepts at the intersections of multi-level governance, policy implementation and participatory governance, namely multilayer implementation, participatory implementation and polycentric governance.","2014-02-07","2018-11-27 16:42:54","2018-11-27 16:42:54","2018-11-27 16:42:54","248-267","","2","21","","","Multi-level governance, policy implementation and participation","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/WKEHUWEF/Newig and Koontz - 2014 - Multi-level governance, policy implementation and .pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/2N84Y5F7/13501763.2013.html","","","EU Air Quality Directives; EU Floods Directive; EU Water Framework Directive; federalism; nested policy cycle; policy delivery.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We claim that the outcome of the interaction significantly depends on the country's form of capitalism. The particular form of capitalism manifested in a country is deeply rooted in historical and cultural behavioural models and differs according to path-dependent institutional changes.

On the conceptual plane, we argue that it is important to separate the analysis of decision-making from that of outcomes: the fact that committees generally end up ratifying Commission proposals does not mean the latter are never contested. Consensus and deliberation being closely related concepts, we propose to focus on dissent within committees, which we regard as an indicator of a non-deliberative process or an imperfect deliberation. Applying this approach to data from the comitology register, we show the existence of a sizeable rate of contestation in various fields, and offer a first analysis of the factors that may influence dissensus.","2014-07-03","2018-11-27 16:54:09","2018-11-27 16:54:09","2018-11-27 16:54:09","842-859","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/N6M9J5NW/Dehousse et al. - 2014 - How consensual is comitology.pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/TKVGD42G/13501763.2014.html","","","Comitology; consensus; decision-making; deliberation; European institutions; unanimity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transcending this EU-centric perspective, we provide a novel conceptualization of the role of third country actors as initiators and drivers, rather than as reactive receivers, of policy transfer. Based on our novel conceptual framework, we identify four strategies through which governments may overcome domestic veto-players and build stakeholder support. Specifically, third country governments may promote the transfer of EU policies by legitimizing policy choices, distributing the costs and benefits associated with a policy; rely on learning from the EU as a ‘resource’; and lock in a certain policy through an agreement with the EU. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of these strategies with respect to the transfer of the EU Emission Trading System to Norway, Switzerland and Australia.","2016-07-02","2018-11-27 16:57:00","2018-11-27 16:57:00","2018-11-27 16:57:00","814-832","","6","23","","","Theorizing third country agency in EU rule transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/G7B5U4EN/Müller and Slominski - 2016 - Theorizing third country agency in EU rule transfe.pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/E27V9CFG/13501763.2015.html","","","Climate policy; emission trading; EU policy transfer; external governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While research has focused on the direct link between policies and preferences, how policies alter individuals’ preferences through indirect means remains less explored. Broadly, we argue that how micro-level factors influence policy preferences is contingent on the policy context, and specifically we contend that how economic risk influences preferences is contingent on the policy institutions that privatize social protection responsibilities. Using healthcare policy as the empirical context, we show that the level of privatization in national healthcare systems will colour how the risk of unemployment affects preferences for government healthcare.","2015-11-26","2018-11-27 16:57:24","2018-11-27 16:57:24","2018-11-27 16:57:24","1489-1511","","10","22","","","Policy feedback and economic risk","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/8QYCJ2JQ/Zhu and Lipsmeyer - 2015 - Policy feedback and economic risk the influence o.pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/ANF5XDHX/13501763.2015.html","","","Economic risk; policy feedback; policy institutions; social policy preferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our point of departure is that this represents a two-fold challenge. It is on the one hand a matter of establishing ‘how federal’ the EU is (the EU’s federal challenge). On the other, the EU has federal features but is not a state; thus raises the question of whether federal theory and practice may have to be adapted to take proper account of the EU (the EU’s challenge to federalism). The contributions to this collection supplement and extend existing scholarship through focusing on two important lines of inquiry. The first focuses on the relationship between federalism and democracy, with particular emphasis on how federal systems respond to and deal with citizens’ interests and concerns, within and outside the political system. Particular emphasis is placed on representation, in the process of federalization, and as a feature of established systems. The second line of inquiry places the emphasis on the relationship among the governments of federal systems. The focus is on intergovernmental relations, and the particular merits that emanate from studying these from a federal perspective.","2017-04-11","2018-11-27 16:58:21","2018-11-27 16:58:21","2018-11-27 16:58:21","467-485","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/IAD2PIK5/Fossum and Jachtenfuchs - 2017 - Federal challenges and challenges to federalism.

Starting from the notion of ‘shared rule’, the article argues that ‘non-centralization’ may occur in a given policy area when the loss of resources at the constituent unit level is not compensated with an equivalent increase in federal powers. In the meantime, horizontal interdependence as well as vertical independence are facilitated through different incentives. The combination of these two factors leads to horizontal coordination where federal actors come to play a different role. The analytical framework advanced in the article is applied to two different cases, the Canadian inter-provincial trade, and the EU’s economic governance framework.","2017-04-11","2018-11-27 16:59:08","2018-11-27 16:59:08","2018-11-27 16:59:08","562-579","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/4KV4ZGXH/Csehi - 2017 - Horizontal coordination in federal political syste.pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/X3H6NMJ8/13501763.2017.html","","","Economic integration; federalism; intergovernmental relations; policy coordination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the variation that exists among the fifteen member states also raises the question of what explains it. In the second half of the article, it is argued that explanations of the variation should start from the complementary aspects of major interdisciplinary schools of thought such as culture theory, institutionalism and rational choice. This leads to a number of interesting new research questions.","1997-09-01","2018-11-27 16:59:32","2018-11-27 16:59:32","2018-11-27 16:59:32","373-387","","3","4","","","National parliaments and EU Affairs Committees","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/Y7R9ZIX2/Bergman - 1997 - National parliaments and EU Affairs Committees no.pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/CHVIHFUM/13501769780000051.html","","","Competing explanations; complementary explanations; Council of Ministers; European Affairs Committees; national advisory process of scrutiny and co-ordination; national parliaments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article explains how this shift of authority could happen and explores whether it will lead to a European healthcare union. It argues that federalism offers the most fruitful way to do so because of its sensitivity to the EU's institutional settings and to the territorial dimension of politics. The division of competences and national diversity of healthcare systems have been major obstacles for the formation of a healthcare union. However, the EU obtained a role in healthcare through the impact of non-healthcare legislation, voluntary co-operation, court rulings, governments’ joint-decision traps and fiscal stress of member states. The emerging European healthcare union is a system of co-operative federalism without much cost-sharing. The healthcare union's robustness is limited, also because it does not generate much loyalty towards the EU.","2016-02-07","2018-11-27 17:01:34","2018-11-27 17:01:34","2018-11-27 17:01:34","157-176","","2","23","","","The making of a European healthcare union","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/DUFT88Q5/Vollaard et al. - 2016 - The making of a European healthcare union a feder.pdf; /Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/3VKY586S/13501763.2015.html","","","European integration; federalism; healthcare; joint-decision trap; patients’ rights directive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of a comparative federalism approach, it investigates the different forms of influence that constituent state governments exercise on the decision-making process of two types of federation. Contrary to federal unions, such as the USA and Switzerland, in the EU the constituent states are represented by their governments. Constituent states are instead represented by their governments in federal states such as Germany (and informally in Canada), but in none of them they play the decision-making role as they do in the EU’s new policies regime. The article thus highlights the legitimacy vacuum in which the intergovernmental institutions operate in the latter policy regime, although this is not the case in the internal market policies regime.","2017-04-11","2018-11-27 17:01:52","2018-11-27 17:01:52","2018-11-27 17:01:52","580-597","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/UYGL9BKV/Fabbrini - 2017 - Intergovernmentalism in the European Union.

This article disentangles the two perspectives by studying the effects of resource wealth on women’s economic and political status in the U.S. states, where resource wealth varies significantly while cultural differences are comparatively small. Data between 1997 and 2012 reveal evidence of a gendered resource curse, consistent with Ross. I also update the theory of the gendered resource curse by showing, via a culture-augmented labor–leisure model of workforce participation, that far from being irrelevant when accounting for varying attitudes toward gender roles, resource wealth and those patriarchal attitudes combine to suppress even more women’s economic and political influence. Data from the U.S. states support this expectation as well.","2016-01-01","2018-11-27 17:26:44","2018-11-27 17:26:44","2018-11-27 17:26:44","115-152","","1","49","","Comparative Political Studies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","/Users/GrantAllard/Documents/Clemson PhD/Literature and Raw Data/Zotero/storage/N48L7JF5/Simmons - 2016 - Resource Wealth and Women’s Economic and Political.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
